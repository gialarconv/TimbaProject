# TimbaProject

This project was created with OpenGL Glut c++.

The purpose of these repositories is to deliver the appropriate functionalities 
for the correct functioning of the test delivered by timba games, 
for the application of a video game developer.

To be honest, this is my first time doing a project of this type, 
I have never worked with a graphic API, so it was a challenge in the first instance, 
to understand the correct operation of things. But luckily I got there without any problems.

I decided to create the project based on classes, 
in which each one of them is in charge of extracting the data to create the shapes.

The timba project.cpp class, is in charge of rendering the objects, 
and it is also in charge of connecting with the glut c ++ library
